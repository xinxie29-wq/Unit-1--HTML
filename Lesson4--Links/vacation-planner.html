    <h1 id="Back to Top">My Dream Trip to France</h1>
    <h2>Ultimate Travel Guide</h2>
    <h2 id="Jump to Trip Research">Trip Research</h2>
    <p>After I deided to fo on a trip, I gained a lot of work. The first thing I am should do is to decide a destination. I go on <a href="https://www.france.fr/en/"target=_blank> Explore France</a>, which is an official tourism website of France, and was attracted by it a lot. After confirming my arriving and leaving time, I begin to search for more information of this beatiful country on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187070-France-Vacations.html"target=_blank>TripAdvisor</a>. This is my first time using it.</p>
    <p>Because France is far north than New Jersey, I also check on <a href="https://weather.com/weather/today/l/a5c27da38afe789545e3446ede0bfd5042030764469a6cd4fff4e9468c74d2a7"target=_blank>Weather</a>. Of course, it is much more colder in Paris than in New Jersey.</p>

    <h2>Getting There and Staying There</h2>
    <h3 id="Jump to Booking Information">Flight and Hotel Booking</h3>
    <p>I first looked for the flight to France by <a href="https://www.expedia.com/"target=_blank>Expedia</a>, to make a more precised schedule. After finishing my schedule, I used <a href="https://www.booking.com/"target=_blank>Booking</a> to find high-rated hotels. Honestly, I was hesitating between beautiful views and beautiful price.</p>
    <h3>Transpoartation Info</h3>
    <p>I would like to rent a car in Paris, then I won't need to worry about how to call taxi there. But I have to place an taxi order from the airport to my hotel. I searched the route on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps"target=_blank>Google Maps</a>.But, when I searched the price on <a href="https://www.g7.fr/en/"target=_blank>a local taxi website</a>, it is more expensive than I thought. So, I decided to go to hotel by metro. I planned the routine on <a href="https://www.ratp.fr/en/plan-metro"target=_blank>RATP</a>. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Paris+Charles+de+Gaulle+Airport+(CDG),+Roissy-en-France,+France/Hilton+Paris+Opera,+108+Rue+Saint-Lazare,+75008+Paris,+France/@48.9417373,2.2865155,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47e63e038e4ccf5b:0x42be0982f5ba62c!2m2!1d2.5507855!2d49.0078827!1m5!1m1!1s0x47e66e356ba7a313:0xe86fbfda470fc392!2m2!1d2.3255604!2d48.8756014!3e3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"target=_blank>Google Map</a> shows that the subway will only take me 57 mintutes to get to the hotel.I am so excited!</p>
