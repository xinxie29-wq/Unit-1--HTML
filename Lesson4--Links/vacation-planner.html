    <h1>My Dream Trip to France</h1>
    <h2>Ultimate Travel Guide</h2>
    <h2>Trip Research</h2>
    <p>After I deided to fo on a trip, I gained a lot of work. The first thing I am should do is to decide a destination. I go on <a href="https://www.france.fr/en/"target=_blank> Explore France</a>, which is an official tourism website of France, and was attracted by it a lot. After confirming my arriving and leaving time, I begin to search for more information of this beatiful country on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187070-France-Vacations.html"target=_blank>TripAdvisor</a>. This is my first time using it.</p>
    <p>Because France is far north than New Jersey, I also check on <a href="https://weather.com/weather/today/l/a5c27da38afe789545e3446ede0bfd5042030764469a6cd4fff4e9468c74d2a7"target=_blank>Weather</a>. Of course, it is much more colder in Paris than in New Jersey.</p>
