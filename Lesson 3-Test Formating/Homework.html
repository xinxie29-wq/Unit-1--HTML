    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>My name legal name is <i>Xintian Xie</i>, but my friends call me <b>Abby</b>. I did not learn about computer science before, but I am really looking forward to programming especially when we finished setting up the environment. I really hope that I can make some useful applications someday in the future. I have not considered about my dream college <b>yet</b>, but I think I will quickly find out.</p>
    <br>One fun fact about me is that I am trying to attend to the band for playing drum. But I only started learning it in <b>this summer!</b>I am still <strong>confident</strong> though.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
    I am an athletic girl, meaning that it is hard for me to stay indoor for more than half a day. I like playing <em><strong>badminton</strong></em>, especially with <b>my dad</b>. I practice badminton from my first grade, but it is still challenging, because my dad is really good at it.
    <p>I also like <strong>running in the duck pond</strong> near my home. I am always joyful when I watch duck and geese swimming in the pond while I am doing workouts.</p>
